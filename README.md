# Blockchain-Based Fighter Jet Supply Chain Management

This project secures the supply chain for fighter jet components using blockchain technology. Built on Ethereum, it ensures transparency, authenticity, and quality of critical parts while preventing counterfeiting and inefficiencies.

## Features
- **Smart Contract Integration:** Tracks each component's lifecycle.
- **Frontend Interface:** User-friendly dashboard to interact with the blockchain.
- **Authentication:** Verifies authenticity and ownership.
- **Decentralized and Secure:** Immutable records stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Solidity Smart Contracts
- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm
- MetaMask (for blockchain interaction)
- Truffle or Remix (for deploying the smart contract)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-supply-chain.git
   cd blockchain-supply-chain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contract using Remix or Truffle.

4. Update the `contractAddress` in `app.js` to match the deployed contract's address.

5. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the frontend.

## Usage
- **Register Components:** Add new components to the supply chain.
- **Track History:** View the lifecycle of any component.
- **Verify Ownership:** Authenticate parts and their origins.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with IoT for real-time tracking.
- Advanced analytics for predictive maintenance.
- Support for multiple blockchain networks.
